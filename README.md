# Fronted

This project was build with Gridsome, a lightweight Vuejs framework to generate static files.
I have a basic knowledge of React, but I'm not having much time right now, so I used what I'm confortable with.
# Backend

About the backend, I was learning Typescript last month, so I tried to use it on this project to pratice.
### 1. Install Gridsome CLI tool if you don't have

`npm install --global @gridsome/cli`

### 2. Create a Gridsome project

1. `gridsome create my-gridsome-site` to install default starter
2. `cd my-gridsome-site` to open the folder
3. `gridsome develop` to start a local dev server at `http://localhost:8080`
4. Happy coding ðŸŽ‰ðŸ™Œ
